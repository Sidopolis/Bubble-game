# Bubble-Popper

Bubble Popper is a simple but challenging game that will test your reflexes and your luck. The goal of the game is to pop as many bubbles as possible before the timer runs out. The bubbles are randomly generated, and each bubble has a different value. If you pop a bubble with the same value as the hit number, you will get 10 points. If you pop a bubble with a different value, you will not get any points. The game ends when the timer runs out or when you pop all of the bubbles.

This project is a great way to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is also a fun and challenging game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

Challenges I faced

The biggest challenge I faced while developing this project was creating the bubble popping animation. I wanted the bubbles to pop in a satisfying way, but I also wanted to make sure that the animation was not too slow or too fast. I also had to make sure that the bubbles were not popping too close together, as this could cause the game to lag.

Features I am most proud of

I am most proud of the bubble popping animation. I think it is very satisfying to see the bubbles pop, and I also think it is a good representation of the challenge of the game. I am also proud of the way the game is scored. I think the scoring system is fair and it encourages players to keep playing and trying to improve their score.

Future plans for the project

I plan to add more features to Bubble Popper in the future. I would like to add different types of bubbles, such as exploding bubbles and sticky bubbles. I would also like to add a level system, so that players can progress through the game and unlock new features.

I hope you enjoy playing Bubble Popper!
