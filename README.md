# Bubble-game
This project is a simple bubble popping game. The goal of the game is to pop as many bubbles as possible before the timer runs out. The bubbles are randomly generated, and each bubble has a different value. If you pop a bubble with the same value as the hit number, you will get 10 points. If you pop a bubble with a different value, you will not get any points. The game ends when the timer runs out or when you pop all of the bubbles.
